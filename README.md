Description
This project demonstrates how to create a responsive and interactive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The menu is designed to be visually appealing with a gradient background and interactive elements that respond to user actions, such as hovering over menu items or scrolling the page. The navigation menu has the following features:

Fixed Position: The navigation bar is fixed at the top of the page, ensuring it remains visible as the user scrolls through the content.
Hover Effects: Menu items change color and style when the user hovers over them, enhancing the user experience.
Scroll Effects: The navigation bar changes its background color when the user scrolls down the page, providing a visual cue that the user has moved away from the top of the page.


Usage
HTML Structure: The HTML code provides the basic structure of the web page, including a fixed-position navigation bar and multiple content sections (home, about, services, and contact). Each section represents a different part of the website.

CSS Styling: The CSS code styles the navigation bar, menu items, and the overall page layout. Key features include:

A gradient background for the navigation bar.
Hover effects for menu items to make them more interactive.
A scroll-triggered background color change for the navigation bar to indicate page movement.
JavaScript Interaction: The JavaScript code adds interactivity by listening for the scroll event. When the user scrolls down the page, the JavaScript function modifies the CSS class of the navigation bar, changing its background color.


Result
When the code is executed in a web browser, the following results can be observed:

Fixed Navigation Bar: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page as the user scrolls, ensuring easy access to different sections of the website.

Interactive Hover Effects: When the user hovers over any menu item, the background and font color of the item change, making it visually distinct and providing a clear indication of which item is being interacted with.

Scroll-Triggered Background Change: As the user scrolls down the page, the background color of the navigation bar changes. This effect gives a visual indication that the user has scrolled away from the top of the page, enhancing the navigational experience.


Conclusion
This code demonstrates a practical implementation of a modern, interactive navigation menu using basic web technologies. The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. The key takeaways include:

Fixed Position Navigation: Ensures that the navigation bar is always accessible, improving site usability.

Hover and Scroll Effects: Enhance the interactivity and visual appeal of the website, making the user experience more engaging.

Modular and Reusable: The code structure is modular, meaning it can easily be adapted or expanded for other projects. The hover and scroll effects can be customized further to match specific design requirements.
